**Projects:**

**Optimistic Concurrency Control**, August, 2015 - April, 2016 <br/>
Advisor: [Sathya Peri](http://www.iith.ac.in/~sathya_p/), Associate Professor, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad 

I contributed to a *poster presentation* in the Ph.D. Forum of **IPDPS 2016** and also to the CSE day, IIT Hyderabad. I worked on optimistic version of FOCC and improved the existing performance of the FOCC reducing abort counts by using independent locks on data items.

[**Neural Turing Machines**](github.com/HimaVarsha94/NTM), February - April, 2016 <br/>
Advsior: [Dr. Vineeth Balasubramanyam](http://iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/)

Implemented not only Neural Turing Machines by Alex Graves et. al using Lua and Torch but also added implementations of GRU along with the LSTM already present. I also made a conclusive report on NTM possibilities in basic signal processing algorithms.

[**QuickSlots v2.0**](https://github.com/HimaVarsha94/QuickSlots), February - April, 2016 <br/>
Advsiors: [Dr. Ramakrishna Upadrasta](http://www.iith.ac.in/~ramakrishna/), [Dr. MV Panduranga Rao](http://www.iith.ac.in/~mvp/), [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](http://iith.ac.in/) 

I built a Timetable Scheduler for the {\it Computer Science Department, IIT Hyderabad}. The input to the system is faculty's preferences and the output is a consolidated time-table. The problem was modelled as {\bf Min Cost Bipartite Matching}. A mathematical formulation for edge weights was created based on factors like time and venue conflicts, student batch size and course kind.

**Action Recognition in Videos**, Aug - Nov, 2015 <br/>
Advsior: [Dr. Vineeth Balasubramanyam](http://iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/), Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad

I made an application to predict the sport given a video which was chosen from a subset of UCF Sports dataset. The features were generated using HOG+HOF+MBH (Dense Trajectories), made into Bag of Words descriptors by k-means clustering. It was trained using SVM and achieved an accuracy of about 40\%. 

[**Port Scanner**](github.com/HimaVarsha94/Port-Scanner), August - Nov, 2014 <br/>
Advisor: [Dr. Kotaro Kataoka](http://cse.iith.ac.in/profile/faculty/kotaro/)Visiting Assistant Professor, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad

A Linux based application with backend in C and frontend in Python. It returns open ports which can also help to identify the underlying applications.
